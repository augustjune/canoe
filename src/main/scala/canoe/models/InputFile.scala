/** This object represents the contents of a file to be uploaded.
  * Must be posted using multipart/form-data in the usual way that files are uploaded via the browser.
  *
  * Resending files without reuploading
  * There are two ways of sending a file (photo, sticker, audio etc.).
  *     If it's a new file, you can upload it using multipart/form-data.
  *     If the file is already on our servers, you don't need to reupload it: each file object has a file_id field, you can simply pass this file_id as a parameter instead.
  *
  * It is not possible to change the file type when resending by file_id. I.e. a video can't be sent as a photo, a photo can't be sent as a document, etc.
  * It is not possible to resend thumbnails.
  * Resending a photo by file_id will send all of its sizes.
